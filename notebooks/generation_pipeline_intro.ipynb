For two decades, they had played 24 Test matches, enduring a string of losses and a few hard-fought draws, but never quite managing to cross the finish line with a win. This victory was thus the culmination of 20 years of waiting, struggle, and perseverance.\\n\\n2.  **The Context of the Series:** The match was the 5th and final Test of a five-match series against the touring English team, led by Donald Carr. England had already won the series, leading 1-0 with three draws. India's win meant they avoided a series whitewash and ended the series on a high note, drawing it 1-1.\\n\\n3.  **The Venue:** The historic victory took place at the MA Chidambaram Stadium (then known as the Madras Cricket Club Ground), a ground that would later become famous for its spin-friendly pitches.\\n\\n4.  **Key Performances – The Architects of Victory:**\\n    *   **Vinoo Mankad's All-Round Brilliance:** The legendary Indian all-rounder was the undisputed hero of the match. With the ball, he delivered a heroic performance, taking **8 wickets for 55 runs in the first innings** and following it up with **4 wickets for 53 runs in the second innings**, finishing with incredible match figures of 12/108. He also contributed a crucial 35 runs with the bat.\\n    *   **Ghulam Ahmed's Support:** Mankad was ably supported by fellow spinner Ghulam Ahmed, who took 4/77 in the first innings, ensuring England were bundled out cheaply.\\n    *   **Batting Dominance:** After restricting England, India's batsmen rose to the occasion. **Pankaj Roy (111)** and **Polly Umrigar (130*)** both scored maiden Test centuries, laying a strong foundation and allowing India to declare their innings with a massive lead.\\n\\n5.  **The Match Result:** India won by an emphatic **innings and 8 runs**.\\n    *   England 1st Innings: 266 all out (Mankad 8/55)\\n    *   India 1st Innings: 457/9 declared (Umrigar 130*, Roy 111)\\n    *   England 2nd Innings: 183 all out (Mankad 4/53)\\n\\n6.  **Significance and Impact:**\\n    *   **Immense Psychological Boost:** This victory was far more than just a notch in the win column.
